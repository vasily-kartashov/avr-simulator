This program is a simulator/debugger for Atmel AVR flash microcontrollers, built
with Motif (incompatible with Less Tiff). It has language independent interface.
This version can almost fully simulates AT90S and ATmega series. Debugger allows
you to see and change any piece of memory, like registers, I/O ports, RAM and
EEPROM at any time. It is possible to imitate I/O ports by means of reading data
from a file and saving I/O ports in a file. Clock frequency of microcontroller and
WatchDog timer are changeable.
