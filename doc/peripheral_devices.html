This section describes what peripheral devices are supported. Interrupts
are worked for all devices.

<p><b>Timer/Counter0,Timer/Counter1,Timer/Counter2,Timer/Counter3</b><br>
All timers are fully supported by the Simulator. As in real device
every 16-bit Timer has TEMP register. Double buffer is also
supported for OCRx

<p><b>Timer/Counter1</b><br>
For the devices AT90S8515 and AT90S4414,
the ICP function is set up on PD4 and the OC1B function is set up on PD6.

<!-- <p><big>Watchdog Timer</big><br>
The Watchdog Timer is fully supported by the Simulator.
For default the Watchdog oscillator runs at 1MHz but you can change it by 
<a href="project_window.html">Project Window</a> from 
Option menu. When Watchdog reset is occured then CPU will be in reset state
for the <b>Reset Delay Time-Out Period</b>. You can change Reset Delay
Time-Out Period by using <a href="project_window.html">Project Window</a>. -->

<!-- <p><big>EEPROM</big><br> 
The EEPROM is fully supported by the Simulator. When the EEPROM is
read or written CPU is halted for some clock cycles before the next
instruction is executed.  Number of clocks depeneds from used CPU. The
write access time is set to defaul 2.5ms but it is easy to
change. EEPROM interrupt is supported also. The WDR instruction is
supported. -->

<!-- <p><big>UART</big><br> 
Only interrupts are supported by the Simulator. -->

<p><b>Analog Comparator</b><br>
The Analog Comparator is fully supported by the Simulator. When the
AIN0 is '1' and the AIN1 is '0' the Analog Comparator Output, ACO is
set to '1' in any other cases it is set to '0'.

<!--<p><big>ADC</big><br> 
Only interrupt is supported by the Simulator. -->

<p><b>Ports</b><br>
Ports are simulated as on the real device. As additional option you
can make log files of changing ports and stimulate ports from a file.

<!-- <p><big>External Interrupts</big><br>
External interrupts are fully supported by the Simulator. -->
