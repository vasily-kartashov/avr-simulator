If you already have the source file unziped and untarred, please
issue the following commands:

<path-to-your-Motif-bin>/xmkmf -a
make

And you are lucky, your computer will make the program.

If xmkmf fails, you can try to use Makefile.generic
Copy it into Makefile, edit and try 

make 

Good luck!
